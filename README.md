In theory, you only need to install numpy, matplotlib, scikit-image, and scipy libraries to execute main.py, but there are other libraries included in requirements.txt as such libraries are installed with their dependencies.
If you don't have any of the three libraries, type:

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

.
genshape.py only has four shapes for demonstration: ['circle', 'elipse', 'contour', 'sphere'].
Navigate to this directory on your machine and run main.py with:

python3 main.py

.
Instructions will follow to generate shapes of your choice, or if you wish to see a sample of the program execution type:

python3 main.py sample

.
